# Contribution Guidelines

This project is always accepting contributions. This use case is still fairly
niche but is also an active area of development in the Linux world. If you have
insights on how to improve the existing role set or expand it to another use
case, this document will help you get started.

### I'm having issues using the role(s), but I'm not sure I'm doing it right

Open a discussion! You may ervy well have unconvered a bug or missing
documentation, and we can file an issue on your behalf and get to work.

### I'm having issues using the role, and I'm pretty sure something is wrong

Open an issue! The template will guide you through expected information,
and you are not expected to have insights on how to fix it. Please take the
time to search for an existing issue, but no worries if you accidentally
submit a duplicate.

### There is something wrong with the role, and I think I know how to fix it

Open a pull request! You don't need to submit an issue or discussion post,
we will talk about it in the comments of your PR itself.

### I would like to use the role, but it's not flexible enough for my use case

Open an issue! The feature request template will guide you through expected
information. You generally don't need to open discussion posts on problems
related to:
- Moving hard-coded elements to variables/arguments
- Removing tasks from the role to allow the caller to manage them better
- Disabling tasks using new arguments or conditionals

### I would like to use the role, but it doesn't cover my exact use case

Open a discussion post! Discussions are a great way to figure out whether
your use case is in scope for the project before opening an issue or PR.

### My question isn't covered here

Open a discussion post! Please tell us what you want to accomplish, and
we can figure out the best way to go about it together,


Thanks!
